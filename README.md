# Merge-Sort Algorithm
This is a merge sort algorithm I managed to find online for our code research project. I chose this code because I think it gives a good, indepth look at how varibles, interation, loops and functions can all work together to work with concepts like arrays and intergers to produce a result. I hope that this works for a project and if you guys
have any feedback please just let me know.

# Hot and Cold number guessing game
In this chunk of code I've gone ahead and whipped up a game of guess the number, letting the user inch their way towards a random number determined by the computer by taking their
answers and telling them if they are warmer if they have chosen a number that is closer to the number picked by the computer or colder if they are further. This continues until they
guess the correct number. They will then be given a score based on how many guesses it took to get to the answer and then be prompted if they would like to play another game or quit.

# Paper Scissors Rock
And so here, I've whipped up my own rock paper scissors simulation. It works by having an array containing each possible hand to throw (paper, scissors or rock) and selecting one
at random. The user is then allowed to select paper, scissors or rock and have compared to the computer. The computer is then able to print out a response indicating if the user
won or not. It is then able to ask if the player would like to try again or end the game. This too will have an appropriate response.
