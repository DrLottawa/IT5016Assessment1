### Merge-Sort Algorithm
This is a merge sort algorithm I managed to find online for our code research project. I chose this code because I think it gives a good, indepth look at how varibles, interation, loops and functions can all work together to work with concepts like arrays and intergers to produce a result. I hope that this works for a project and if you guys
have any feedback please just let me know.

### Hot and Cold number guessing game
In this chunk of code I've gone ahead and whipped up a game of guess the number, letting the user inch their way towards a random number determined by the computer by taking their
answers and telling them if they are warmer if they have chosen a number that is closer to the number picked by the computer or colder if they are further. This continues until they
guess the correct number. They will then be given a score based on how many guesses it took to get to the answer and then be prompted if they would like to play another game or quit.

### Paper Scissors Rock
And so here, I've whipped up my own rock paper scissors simulation. It works by having an array containing each possible hand to throw (paper, scissors or rock) and selecting one
at random. The user is then allowed to select paper, scissors or rock and have compared to the computer. The computer is then able to print out a response indicating if the user
won or not. It is then able to ask if the player would like to try again or end the game. This too will have an appropriate response.

# Reflective Thoughts and Input

## What is Python
Python is a high-level programming language that places an emphasis on a streamlined and simplified coding experience through the use of user-friendly and human-readable syntax, dynamic typing, whitespace indentation and more. It can be applied to a plethora of use-cases from data-science through its in-built mathematic and data manipulation tools, web devlopment through frameworks such as Django or native appliations. Through these tools python allows us to design, build and test programs that allow us to achieve our goals and project ideas.

## What is an IDE
An IDE, or Integrated Developer Environment, is a piece of softwere designed for the streamlining, accommodation and assistance of software development. Usually with a specific programming language in mind, an IDE houses a compilation of tools, services, frameworks and convenience settings that provide a devloper a robust and powerful environment to create any kind of software in. These services and tools are typically configured in a matter that allows them to work with each other out of the box and in an efficient manner.

## What is OOP
OOP or Object Oriented Programming is an applied programming paradigm which utilises a methodology based around referential template types or objects in order to organise, simplify and standardise a piece of computer software. These objects typically contain properties which may be manipulated, accessed or referenced in relation to the specific instance of the object which is being refrenced. When a developer wishes to use an object, they may first create an instance of said object which is usually accompanied by the initalisation and setting of the properties within this object. This can either be done by assigning default values through get-setters which have their values parsed at run-time or by manually specifying the properties when a new object is initiallised. OOP furthur extends the functionality of these objects through use of keywords, inheritance, polymorphism and many other attributes and means of functionality so that it may serve the purposes of assiting in being the core and defining mechanism of which the paradigm bases itself upon

## What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism is a core concept of OOP. Polymorphism works to allow an object or method to take on many different forms. Polymorphism comes under several different categories depending upon how it is utilised. Methods for example can be defined multiple times in an object under the same name as long as they hold some kind of difference in their initalisation configuration, may that be by having a different set of parameters or by having another kind of return type, each providing a completely different set of instructions from one another. This kind of polymorphism is called ad-hoc polymorphism or operator overloading. Another form of polymorphism allows the use of generic handling of values passed in during initalisation of an object or method. This object or method that the value is being passed to is able to manipulate and handle the value, acting upon any functionalities it may have using whatever generic value is passed in. This is known as parametric polymorphism. One last type of polymorphism is subtyping. Subtyping involves the use of an abstract superclass which defines some common methods and properties, methods and properties which then go on be applied to anything that inherits said class. This class is typically called a base class and serves to be a point of common ground. In a way the base class is able to be applied many different types of objects which is the paramount feature of polymorphism.

## What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?
The lower C languages absolutely, probably C++. I want to get into these languages as a means of being able to learn and become proficient in subjects such as memory management, pointers whilst being able to utilise the C-like syntax that I'm familiar with. I also would love to find out the just what goes into making highly efficient programs and software such as device drivers and embedded systems. I understand it is a hard road though but learning is fun and I think it would be good for me to start dipping my toes into realms of software development other than web dev

## What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?
Actually, it was going through and fully udnerstanding recursion, specifically when it was utilised in the merge sort algorithm I found. I have never dealt with recursion before it actually took quite a bit to wrap my head around it. Eventually after carefully going through the steps in my mind and even utilising a notepad and a pen I managed to figure out the exact sequence in my hand and produce a proper response as to how exactly it worked.

## Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
Absolutely. I see creativity as a tool which allows us to find new angles of approach towards anything we work with, especially in logic. With a topic like programming, finding a specific set of logic does involve a high level in creativity to be able to think of differing approaches to a problem. If one cannot employee creativity in their problems they will be forced to brute force inefficent methods to achieve their goals. Creativity allows us, especially programmers, to chip away at stranger angles and perspectives in order to mine new solutions that get the job done better and more elegantly.
