### Merge-Sort Algorithm
This is a merge sort algorithm I managed to find online for our code research project. I chose this code because I think it gives a good, indepth look at how varibles, interation, loops and functions can all work together to work with concepts like arrays and intergers to produce a result. I hope that this works for a project and if you guys
have any feedback please just let me know.

### Hot and Cold number guessing game
In this chunk of code I've gone ahead and whipped up a game of guess the number, letting the user inch their way towards a random number determined by the computer by taking their
answers and telling them if they are warmer if they have chosen a number that is closer to the number picked by the computer or colder if they are further. This continues until they
guess the correct number. They will then be given a score based on how many guesses it took to get to the answer and then be prompted if they would like to play another game or quit.

### Paper Scissors Rock
And so here, I've whipped up my own rock paper scissors simulation. It works by having an array containing each possible hand to throw (paper, scissors or rock) and selecting one
at random. The user is then allowed to select paper, scissors or rock and have compared to the computer. The computer is then able to print out a response indicating if the user
won or not. It is then able to ask if the player would like to try again or end the game. This too will have an appropriate response.

# Reflective Thoughts and Input

## What is Python
Python is a high-level programming language that places an emphasis on a streamlined and simplified coding experience through the use of user-friendly and human-readable syntax, dynamic typing, whitespace indentation and more. It can be applied to a plethora of use-cases from data-science through its in-built mathematic and data manipulation tools, web devlopment through frameworks such as Django or native appliations. Through these tools python allows us to design, build and test programs that allow us to achieve our goals and project ideas.

## What is an IDE
An IDE, or Integrated Developer Environment, is a piece of softwere designed for the streamlining, accommodation and assistance of software development. Usually with a specific programming language in mind, an IDE houses a compilation of tools, services, frameworks and convenience settings that provide a devloper a robust and powerful environment to create any kind of software in. These services and tools are typically configured in a matter that allows them to work with each other out of the box and in an efficient manner.

## What is OOP
OOP or Object Oriented Programming is an applied programming paradigm which utilises a methodology based around referential template types or objects in order to organise, simplify and standardise a piece of computer software. These objects typically contain properties which may be manipulated, accessed or referenced in relation to the specific instance of the object which is being refrenced.

When a developer wishes to use an object, they may first create an instance of said object which is usually accompanied by the initalisation and setting of the properties within this object. This can either be done by assigning default values through get-setters which have their values parsed at run-time or by manually specifying the properties when a new object is initiallised. OOP furthur extends the functionality of these objects through use of keywords, inheritance, polymorphism and many other attributes and means of functionality so that it may serve the purposes of assiting in being the core and defining mechanism of which the paradigm bases itself upon

## What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism is a core concept of OOP. Polymorphism works to allow an object or method to take on many different forms. Polymorphism comes under several different categories depending upon how it is utilised. Methods for example can be defined multiple times in an object under the same name as long as they hold some kind of difference in their initalisation configuration, may that be by having a different set of parameters or by having another kind of return type, each providing a completely different set of instructions from one another. This kind of polymorphism is called ad-hoc polymorphism or operator overloading.

Another form of polymorphism allows the use of generic handling of values passed in during initalisation of an object or method. This object or method that the value is being passed to is able to manipulate and handle the value, acting upon any functionalities it may have using whatever generic value is passed in. This is known as parametric polymorphism.
 
One last type of polymorphism (of which there are several) is subtyping. Subtyping involves the use of an abstract superclass which defines some common methods and properties, methods and properties which then go on be applied to anything that inherits said class. This class is typically called a base class and serves to be a point of common ground. In a way the base class is able to be applied many different types of objects which is the paramount feature of polymorphism.

## What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?
The lower C languages absolutely, probably C++. I want to get into these languages as a means of being able to learn and become proficient in subjects such as memory management, pointers whilst being able to utilise the C-like syntax that I'm familiar with. I also would love to find out the just what goes into making highly efficient programs and software such as device drivers and embedded systems. I understand it is a hard road though but learning is fun and I think it would be good for me to start dipping my toes into realms of software development other than web dev

## What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?
Actually, it was going through and fully udnerstanding recursion, specifically when it was utilised in the merge sort algorithm I found. I have never dealt with recursion before it actually took quite a bit to wrap my head around it. Eventually after carefully going through the steps in my mind and even utilising a notepad and a pen I managed to figure out the exact sequence in my hand and produce a proper response as to how exactly it worked.

## Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
Absolutely. I see creativity as a tool which allows us to find new angles of approach towards anything we work with, especially in logic. With a topic like programming, finding a specific set of logic does involve a high level in creativity to be able to think of differing approaches to a problem. If one cannot employee creativity in their problems they will be forced to brute force inefficent methods to achieve their goals. Creativity allows us, especially programmers, to chip away at stranger angles and perspectives in order to mine new solutions that get the job done better and more elegantly.

## What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
Not under the name timeboxing but I have absolutely heard of this. Timeboxing is an organisational tool based upon breaking up tasks into several different chunks or timeboxes. From here you assess roughly how much time a particular time a task will take and assign a block of time to your schedule, attempting to finish these task in time and if not moving anyway to whatever the next box in your schedule is. This is effective in motivating yourself to finish something in a specific time period, being able to access the actual complexity of a given task according to if it actually required the allocated amount of time or if it needed more, and that you can have a pre-defined list of task and goals to follow through with so that you may seamless move from one task to another in a logical and quick manner without much in the way of planning or thinking inbetween that could be utilised for work. 

Now in terms of if I would use it, if you're reading this you are likely privy to the fact that I have already used this! My team and I have been given instruction as to the use of timeboxing and software to assist in it. That said for my studies I actually think it an opportunity to go without this for of organisation. Personally I tend to get into bouts and moods of focus that allow me to fully pay attention and hone in on one particular subject or piece of work that I am working with (in fact I'm doing it now!) and as such I like to fully utilise these periods as much as possible and switching away form one task to another may prove to be my detriment rather than a benefit to my productivity.

## Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
I'm a little guilty of neglecting this. Typically when I fully engage in work I can find myself absorbed in my work for several hours without getting work. This is a less apparent when I'm doing work at home as I often get up to go interract with my family. These are still typically hour long stretches of work however and could probably do with a greater frequency. Perhaps an alarm?
